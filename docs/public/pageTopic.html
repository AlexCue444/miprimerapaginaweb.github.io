<p>Here is a brief overview of the Topic from my Practical Work I: ETHICAL HACKING <br/><br/>
    In the world of technology and computers, hacking is a widespread practice that should not be undermined. Besides being a main discipline of computer engineering, it can sometimes be used in malicious ways. Hacking is used to commit crimes, whether for economic, military or political purposes. As with other tools, there are people who make the decision to use it to do evil. This is why we should know what ethical hacking is and how we should apply it.

<br/>
<p>Ethical hacking is a professional outlet or practice within the field of computer science that tries to solve or defend against hacker attacks. This works by trying to imitate a malicious hacker and identifying the security problems. Then solving these vulnerabilities through a legal and ethical use of hacking. 

</p>
<br/><br/>
<p>Many high-level companies are hiring cybersecurity professionals to apply ethical hacking. These are dedicated to detecting and resolving vulnerability problems that can be found in computer systems or programs with the objective that no one can access the information, much less manipulate it.

</p>
<br/><br/>
<p>As a final point to be made, Ethical hacking is a growing profession. If hacking techniques evolve and change or improve, ethical hacking will also increase. Therefore, it is a profession that not only has a future and will not end or disappear in the short term, but it will increase exponentially in the era in which we live.
